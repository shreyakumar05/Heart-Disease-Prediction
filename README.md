# Heart-Disease

It is always very essential to be pretty accurate while dealing with crucial data such as the heart disease dataset. This dataset has been acquired from Kaggle. We will try to be as accurate as possible. This dataset gives a number of variables along with a target condition of having or not having heart disease. We'll do exploratory data analysis on the dataset first and then implement ML models and compare them to see which one performs the best.
